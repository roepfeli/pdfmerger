# pdfmerger

A simple tool that merges pdfs.

## Usage

First create a directory which only contains all pdfs that you
want to merge.

Second name them so they are sorted alphabetically.

Third invoke the python-script with the name of the directory and the name of resulting merged pdf-file:

```
./merge.py <pdf_directory> <name_of_merged_pdf>
```

Dont forget to change the permissions:

```
chmod +x merge.py
```
